### Gradle Building Exercise

This is a Gradle exercise. On it, you will find the use of [Convention Plugins](https://docs.gradle.org/current/samples/sample_convention_plugins.html),
this project is a single module project, the advantage of having this in place
is that if in the future, you find the need to change it into a multimodule
project, you will be set to do it.

Also, you will find the use of [Version Catalogs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html)
which allows to manage versions for multiple dependencies in single or multimodule
setups.
